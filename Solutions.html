              <h2>Technology and Applications</h2>
              <p>Neutral atom device architectures are unique in many ways, not only in comparison with classical
                devices in general but also with respect to its quantum counterparts. For example, in relation to
                other quantum devices, neutral atom platforms can reach quantum registers with a larger number
                of qubits and higher connectivity with relative ease.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="service-item">
              <h2>Exploring Quantum Simulation</h2>
              <p>The most promising application of Neoqn’s QPU is Quantum Simulation, where the quantum
                processor is used to gain knowledge over a quantum system of interest. As Richard Feynman already
                pointed out in the last century, it seems natural to use a quantum system as a computational
                resource for quantum problems. Pure science discovery will benefit from neutral atom quantum
                processors, and fields of applications are numerous at the industrial level, including for example the
                engineering of new materials for energy storage and transport, or chemistry calculations for drug
                discovery.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="service-item">
              <h2>Surpassing the Classical Simulation Threshold </h2>
              <p>Recent advancements have allowed us to reach unprecedented system sizes, with quantum registers
                of 100+ atoms. This number of interacting quantum particles enables the simulation of a many-body
                quantum system’s dynamics well beyond the capabilities of state-of-the art classical methods.

            <div class="service-item">
              <h2>Solving Hard Optimization</h2>
              <p>Beyond the simulation of scientific processes, Neoqn processors can already be used to solve hard
                computational problems, for which classical computers are inefficient. One important example is the
                native resolution of a well-known graph problem, Maximum Independent Set (MIS). This problem,
                which has various direct applications in network design or finance, becomes hard to solve on a
                classical computer when the size of the graph grows.
